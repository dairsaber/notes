1. ### Install Multipass on MacOS

   [Download Multipass for MacOS](https://multipass.run/download/macos)

   Run the installer in an account with Administrator privileges.

   If you'd like to use Multipass with VirtualBox use this terminal command:

   ```
   sudo multipass set local.driver=virtualbox
   ```

2. ### How to launch LTS instances

   The first five minutes with Multipass let you know how easy it is to have a lightweight cloud handy. Let’s launch a few LTS instances, list them, exec a command, use cloud-init and clean up old instances to start.

   Launch an instance (by default you get the current Ubuntu LTS)

   ```
   multipass launch --name foo
   ```

   Run commands in that instance, try running bash (logout or ctrl-d to quit)

   ```
   multipass exec foo -- lsb_release -a
   ```

   Pass a cloud-init metadata file to an instance on launch. See [using cloud-init with multipass](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2018/04/02/using-cloud-init-with-multipass) for more details

   ```
   multipass launch -n bar --cloud-init cloud-config.yaml
   ```

   See your instances

   ```
   multipass list
   ```

   Stop and start instances

   ```
   multipass stop foo bar
   ```

   ```
   multipass start foo
   ```

   Clean up what you don’t need

   ```
   multipass delete bar
   ```

   ```
   multipass purge
   ```

   Find alternate images to launch with multipass

   ```
   multipass find
   ```

   Get help

   ```
   multipass help
   ```

   ```
   multipass help <command>
   ```

   Now don’t forget you still have `'foo'` running. To learn more about Multipass keep reading, [go to the docs](https://multipass.run/docs), or [join the discussion and get involved.](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/multipass/21)
